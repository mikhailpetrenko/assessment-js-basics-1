// In this section you will answer some work through problems 
// related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the 
    Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. \
Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisIfRequirements = "the phase where stakeholders' \
needs and expectations for a software project are identified and documented to guide the development process"

const design = "Design in SDLC is the phase where the software system's structure and behavior \
are planned and outlined, providing a blueprint for implementation."

const implementation = "The phase where the software solution is developed \
and built according to the design specifications"

const testingAndIntegration = "the phase where the software solution is tested for quality, \
functionality, and compatibility, and then integrated into the overall system"

const maintain = "the phase where the software solution is monitored, updated, \
and improved to ensure its ongoing functionality, reliability, and performance"
